Project #0 : Tic Tac Toe
=========================
Introduction
-------------------------
This game was created as my first web game App at General Assembly.
[Here is the link for my game](https://aibate.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

Big THANK YOU to @Hughsin23 for coaching and guiding me on the right path.

Built with
-------------------
* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* Jquery

My Approach
------------------------------
I kept it simple and so I can focus on Javascript logics.
* used turn counter to assign players turn and use `player1Turn` for distinguishing who's turn.
* listed all winning combinations and create function for judge games `judgeGame`.
* used Jquery to add or clear text inside div and p,
* used jquery `on.('click',())` method for triggering event listener 

Improvement
-----------------------------
* Keep track of multiple game rounds with win counter
* Allow player to customize their tokens ( X, name, picture, etc)
* Layout and styling can be nicer e.g. user hover effect
* Support custom board size which let user to chose a lager board
